# DCGAN
Implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network. The model is trained and tested on 2 datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10. It is based on TensorFlow and uses Keras API for the different layers.

## Generative Adversarial Network

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from the domain) or fake (generated). The two models are trained together in a zero-sum game, adversarial, until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is generating plausible examples.

## Model Architecture

### 1. Generator Model

* The generator model takes input as 100 dimensional noise and produces an image of dimensions (28 x 28 x 1) for MNIST and (32 x 32 x 3) for CIFAR-10.
* It implements upsampling of the input by using Transpose Convolution, followed by Batch Normalization and Leaky Relu layers at each step.
* The last layer is a Transpose Convolution with tanh activation function.

### 2. Discriminator Model

* The discriminator model takes as input the image vector generated by the generator model and gives a single number as output. This number is an indicator for the classification of the image as fake or real.
* Each layer is a Conv2D layer, followed by LeakyRelu and Drouput Layers.
